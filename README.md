### ⚠️ Announcement [Aug '22]
- I decided not to support a centralized, closed source social media platform, and thus further developement for this project is unlikely, at least as of right now.

### ⚠️ Announcement [May '22]
- discord.py is maintained again :tada:
- I don't know if I'll update this project, though

### ⚠️ Announcement [Dec '21]
- This project COULD be revived, as I started working on [NOVΛLIX](https://github.com/nsde/novalix) again.
- I don't know if I even want to do so, becuase **JavaScript is probably much better** for Discord bots and **I started disliking Discord** because of their **marketing** and the fact that they aren't and **wont be open open source** as said in a FAQ or something idk
- I put this in my archive because discord.py died back then, so I lost all my motivation to work on Discord bots at all.

# 🔱 ZeusCord
- ⏲️ ZeusCord's aim is to make it so that **ANYONE can build a Python Discord Bot** (pycord) in **LESS than a MINUTE**!
- 🔗 Use [NOVΛLIX](https://github.com/nsde/novalix)' features! Some of its extensions ("cogs") and its (slash) commands can be used **directly in your bot**!
- 🔥 Supports **new PyCord** instead of the old and deprecated discord.py
- 🪶 Build a basic bot with little to no effort, just by implementing and configuring pre-made extensions!
