# ⚠️ IMPORTANT ANNOUNCEMENT
- This project COULD be revived, as I started working on [NOVALIX](https://github.com/nsde/novalix) again.
- I don't know if I even want to do so, becuase **JavaScript is probably much better** for Discord bots and **I started disliking Discord** because of their **marketing** and the fact that they aren't and **wont be open open source** as said in a FAQ or something idk
- I put this in my archive because discord.py died back then, so I lost all my motivation to work on Discord bots at all.
